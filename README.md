## User Story

As a healthcare professional, I want to accurately calculate common medication doses for pediatric patients based on their age and weight. This includes the ability to select different drugs, input patient parameters, and receive clear and detailed dosage recommendations. The calculator should be user-friendly, providing a quick and efficient way to determine appropriate medication dosages for various pediatric conditions. Additionally, it should display any relevant warnings or considerations for specific drugs or patient characteristics, ensuring the safety and precision of the prescribed doses.
