## Learn new words with this Memory Game!
This memory game aims to allow users to learn new words in a foreign language on the go - while on the train or waiting for your food.

In this 4x3 game, you will have to match words of the same meaning to win. Users can select the category, difficulty level and language (Indonesian & Korean for now!). Difficulty level corresponds to the time given to complete the game, so if you select 'easy', you will be given more time to solve the game.
