# Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp: Project 1: Frontend App

# Background
This project was created in a bid to simplify the user experience for users who would like to compute their GPA, for their university modules. There are a few assumptions:
1. This project caters specifically to NUS academic grading system
2. This project assumes that each module is of 4 academic credits

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs the packages and libraries required to run the application

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# Future Enhancements
1. Allow user to configure the weightage of each module
2. Allow user to choose from a list of pre-selected module codes/names
3. Allow user to specify university and conditionally change GPA computation logic.
