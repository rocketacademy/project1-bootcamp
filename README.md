## Project: Currency Converter App

### Rationale for building this project

I have yet to see (or maybe I did not explore wide enough) an app that allows you to freely convert any Fiat or Crypto Currency to and fro each other. Most of the time, Cryptocurrency apps would allow you to change from USD (or other major Fiat Currencies) to other Crypto Currencies. Hence, I wanted to create an app that allowed you to convert from any Fiat or Crypto Currency that you wish to.

Additionally, this app is meant to be a minimalist app - which just shows you what you want: the conversion rates of two currencies that you are interested in. It does away with other eye-catching features like trend graphs and historical rates which might tear you away from your original intention of converting currencies.

### Feature that I am most proud of

The combo box of autocomplete and dropdown box. To enhance user experience, I had tried to create a search box with an autocomplete feature so that the users can just directly type in the symbol they were interested in. However, if they are not sure what currencies are available, then they would need a dropdown box to scroll through the available currencies.
Hence, I used the react-select library to create the combo box which greatly enhanced the user interface for this app.

### Points to improve on

Sharpening my computational thinking skills when using React. During the first part of the project, it was difficult to determine which component should go onto which script or another file should have been created to make the codes more readable and modular. While I do think that I have polished up my React thinking skills with this project, there is definitely still a long way to go.
Also, to think of what libraries could be used instead of coding from scratch - while beneficial to code from scratch, it might take away precious time which could be used to enhance the features of the app.
