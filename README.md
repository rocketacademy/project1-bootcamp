# Why use a Burner account?
The reason being that spotify assigns a unique client ID and secret client ID for any app that is created using its development tools that is specific to individual accounts.

Any attempt to log in using your account will result in an  authentication error and being pushed out to the log in page due to a mismatch of the client ID and account.

That is the reason why a burner account was created for any user to test out the functions of the app.
