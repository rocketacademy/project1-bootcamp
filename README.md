https://bc.rocketacademy.co/1-frontend/1.p-frontend-app

**Problem**

For Project 1 I have developed a meeting tracking tool called **Rolodex** which is inspired by a problem my best friend faces. 
- The problem is around meeting people.
- The tools in status quo are either too complicated or ask for too much user info. 
- This leads to people creating excel or Notion templates
- Hence there is no easy way in status quo to document our interactions with people. 
- Documentatiom is important as it helps us to recall the key points of discussions, enabling us to have more quality interactions in the future.

**Solution**

Introducing Rolodex a tool which helps us easily document our meetings
- React App consisting of 2 Components: Form and a Table
- User fills in the form and the entry gets added to the Table
- Table is meant to serve as a log of historical records
- User cannot currently directly edit records from the table but can delete 

**Tools Used**: HTML/CSS/JS built on React JS with MUI for styling
