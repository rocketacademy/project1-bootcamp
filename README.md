## Sudoku Game

Welcome to my Sudoku game! I made this game as part of learning React using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. State is managed in the Game component, which passes props to the other components.

Here are the main features of my game:

1. Choose from three levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
2. Add numbers to the board by clicking the number button and then clicking a square on the grid.
3. Entering the wrong number will highlight the square, column, and/or row where the conflict is.
4. Clear the board and start again by clicking the trash icon.
5. Give up? Click the tick icon to solve the board.
6. Stuck? Click the lightbulb icon to get a hint that will populate a random empty cell on the board.
7. Click the plus icon to change difficulty levels and start a new game.
8. The trophy icon holds your game stats - difficulty level, number of moves made, number of mistakes made, and number of hints used. These reset when you start a new game.
9. Click the Sudoku title at the top of the page for instructions on how to play the game.
10. Click the eraser icon to delete an input on the board.

This game was built for Project 1 of Rocket Academy's Coding Bootcamp.
