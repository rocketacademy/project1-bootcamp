# WAFFLE

## About this Project

Hello! Welcome to my first [Bootcamp](https://bc.rocketacademy.co/1-frontend/1.p-frontend-app) project, a clone of the WAFFLE game. Give it a try [here](https://peanutyabing.github.io/project-waffle/)!

I built this game to practice using React, and chose WAFFLE as I loved playing the [original game](https://wafflegame.net/) created by [James Robinson](https://twitter.com/jamesjessian).

Please tell me what you think and what other features you would like you see in the Discussions.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. In the project directory, you can run _npm start_, to run the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.
