            This app serves as an easy way for people like me or beginners who
            just started to learn music theory. there are many scales to learn
            but major and minor scales are the 2 fundamental scales that should
            be mastered first.

            Currently there are many youtube videos and websites that teach more
            in depth but i believe that this app could serve a purpose like a
            reminder or something to refer back to easily without having to look
            for a website.
