            In music theory, the circle of fifths is a way of organizing the 12
            chromatic pitches as a sequence of perfect fifths.

            Because key signatures can get a little tricky to remember, the
            circle of fifths is a great tool! Let's look at how the key
            signatures coordinate with the circle of fifths below:
          </p>
          <ul className="circle-pointers">
            <li>C Major and A Minor have no sharps and no flats</li>
            <li>G Major and E Minor have 1 sharp</li>
            <li>D Major and B Minor have 2 sharps</li>
            <li>A Major and F# Minor have 3 sharps</li>
            <li>and so onâ€¦</li>
          </ul>
