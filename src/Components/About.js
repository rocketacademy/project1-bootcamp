        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to our home in Upper Thomson where I, Celina and my Hubs, Kok
          will cook for you! Our food is inspired by the big bold flavours of
          Asia, and fueled by our passion for cooking and creating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each menu is designed to highlight specific regions in Asia like
          Indonesia, South Asia, Indochina and North Asia. The process starts
          with researching the cuisine, then cooking, adapting and reinventing
          the dish to a version we like. There is a large variety and abundance
          of fresh Asian herbs and spices in our local markets and itâ€™s a joy
          finding new ways of using them. We focus on dishes less common among
          the local restaurants, so that your experience here can be a
          refreshing, food adventure!
        </p>
        <p>
          We host intimatesuppers in our home near Old Upper Thomson Road, among
          the lush greenery of Pierce Reservoir. Guests can sit out on our patio
          to enjoy their drinks before dinner begins.
        </p>
        <p>We hope to see you here soon!</p>
